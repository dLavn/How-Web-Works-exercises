## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

- What is HTTP?
    Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (how data is sent to and from servers).

- What is a URL?
    Uniform Resource Locator (address/site string to navigate to a website)

- What is DNS?
    Domain Name System (converts URLs into IP Addresses)

- What is a query string?
    A query string lets you format key-value pairs into a URL.

- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
    Get and Post. Get receives data from the server, and Post sends data to the server.

- What is an HTTP request?
    Requests come from clients and go to servers

- What is an HTTP response?
    Responses come from servers and go to clients

- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
    Headers give more information about the HTTP request/response. Some HTTP request headers include Host, Accept, and User-Agent. Some HTTP response headers include Last-Modified and Set-Cookie.

- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
    When you type a URL into a browser,
    1. Your browser uses DNS to convert the URL into an IP address 
    2. The browser makes an HTTP request to the IP address 
    3. The server sends an HTTP response to the client
    4. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds other CSS or JavaScript associated with the HTML 
    5. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those other resources and gets a separate HTTP response from the server for each individual request

## **Part Two: Practice Tools**

1. Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”

2. Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com

3. Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser.

## **Part Three: Explore Dev Tools**

Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>GET</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form action="" method="GET">
        <label for="name">Enter Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
        <label for="email">Enter Email</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>

Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.

Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>POST</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form action="" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Enter Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
        <label for="email">Enter Email</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>

## **Part Four: Explore the URL API**

At times, it's useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser window and change how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly the query string).

[resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)

Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get comfortable with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class.
